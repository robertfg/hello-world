# hello-world
My First GitHub Repository

I'm trying to teach myself programming after a 25 year hiatus.  I started with C in the late 1980s/early 1990s, but now I'm learning Java and JavaScript.  From there, I'm not sure where I'll go, probably wherever I can earn a living.

My goal is to get a job as a computer programmer, or to design my own programs or apps, possibly for maritime use; if not, perhaps games or other business initiatives in the areas of machine learning and big data.
